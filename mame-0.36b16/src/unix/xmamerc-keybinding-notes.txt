### X11 keymapping ###
#
# mapkey	<Xcode>,<Scancode>
#
# Xcode means the HEX code of the key as appears in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
# Scancode means the hexadecimal code that represents the value used for Xmame
# 	in keyboard inputs, as defined in src/osdepend.h xmame source file
# IMPORTANT: 
#	1- Due to some limitations, only LATIN-1 X-codes ( 0x0000-0x00ff ) and
#	Especial X-keycodes ( 0xff00-0xffff ) are supported
#	2- Some keys are keyboard dependent: As Xmame works internally with
#	Standard US-AT keyboard codes, you must take care in remmaping some keys
#

# An example: map space as "firebutton" (Mame predefines it as OSD_KEY_RCONTROL)
# in simbolic Xlib/Mame notation it should be:
#
# mapkey XK_space,OSD_KEY_RCONTROL 
# 
# So looking in X11/keysymdef.h and src/osdepend.h we'll write
# mapkey 0x0020,0x0039
#
# (Other example). To use F8 key to insert coin you shoud use:
# mapkey 0xffc5,0x0004
